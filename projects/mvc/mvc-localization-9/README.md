# Culture fallback

This example uses `AcceptLanguageHeaderRequestCultureProvider` to demonstrate "culture fallback".

```
When searching for a resource, localization engages in "culture fallback". Starting from the requested culture, if not found, it reverts to the parent culture of that culture. As an aside, the CultureInfo.Parent property represents the parent culture. This usually (but not always) means removing the national signifier from the ISO. For example, the dialect of Spanish spoken in Mexico is "es-MX". It has the parent "es"â€”Spanish non-specific to any country.
